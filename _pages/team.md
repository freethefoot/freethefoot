<b>Renata Ona, Founder</b>

<p>For many years, I had a very interesting career in political affairs and technology - but I had blinders on. Every day, I was impacted by stressors like pollution, traffic, lack of access to nature, burn-out, inactivity and more.</p> 

<p>Slowly, I gained balance by learning and practicing various movement arts, schools of thought, and therapies</p>

<p>And along the way I met incredibly passionate professionals. And heard stories of individuals working towards the same goal: seeking body and community improvements for their clients, their families, and themselves.</p> 

But despite ever greater knowledge and technological advancements, society has still fallen behind. And its well known that our lives are being negatively impacted.</p>   

<p>That's why I started FreeTheFoot - to fill these gaps with the knowledge and resources we have today.</p>
