<b>Renata Ona, Founder</b>

<p>For many years, I had a very interesting career in political affairs and technology - but I had blinders on. Every day, I was impacted (but many times unaware) of stressors like pollution, traffic, lack of access to nature, burn-out, inactivity and more.</p> 

<p>Slowly, I gained balance by learning and practicing various movement arts, schools of thought, and therapies. And along the way I met incredibly passionate people.</p> 

<p>Everyone sought the same social improvements for their clients, their families, and themselves. But despite greater knowledge and technological advancements, society seems to have fallen behind.</p>   

<p>That's why I started FreeTheFoot - to fill these gaps with the knowledge and resources we have today.</p>
