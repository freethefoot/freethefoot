<h2 style="color: green;">Who We Are</h2>

We are certified personal trainers, gymnastic coaches, fascial stretch therapists and more. Our advanced education in anatomy, nutrition, and fitness programming began early on and has only grown with time. Together, we have decades of experience as movement students - and educators. After years of observing clients and trends, we aim to address how so many health and wellness issues exist because their causes are deeply embedded in the fabric of Canadian institutions and social structures - but they are reversable. 

<h2 style="color: green;">Mission</h2>

Our mission, or IDEA, is to:
<ul>
  <li>Improve health, wellness, and happiness of Canadians.</li>
  <li>Develop targeted processes and programs to address health and wellness issues.</li>
  <li>Design urban landscapes that celebrate the natural landscape</li>
  <li>Enforce anti-negligence by socializing plans for change amoung Canadian businesses and policy makers.</li>
  <li>Advocate, with like-minded partners, for systemic health and wellness change of Canadian institutions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: green;">Vision</h2>

Our vision is a physically, mentally, and emotionally resilient Canadian population. We believe that our improved processes and programs will get Canadians part-way there. The other part is advocating for design changes of our cities, because this will create lasting, systemic and cultural change. Moreover, urban design that enables access to restorative natural landscapes for all Canadians is more equitable and less negligent than the current system which prohibits access to nature from all Canadians. We believe that conscious design of processes, programs, and urban landscapes is the necessary way of the future.
