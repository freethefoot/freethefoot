My name is Renata, and I'm a <a href="https://ncsf.org/">NCSF Certified Personal Trainer</a>, <a href="https://www.stretchtowin.com/page/what-is-fst">Fascia Stretch Therapist</a>, and an <a href="https://www.gymnasticsontario.ca/education/coach-ed/nccp-course-information/">NCCP-trained Adult Gymnastics Coach</a>. My advanced education in anatomy, nutrition, and fitness programming began in university, during my minor in Health Studies. And I have over a decade of experience as a movement student and educator.

I specialize in training foundational movements. And I enjoy practicing gentle, restorative therapies that are fascinating in how they can aid in burnout recovery and improve self-esteem. I truly believe these are the first steps toward reaching - and maintaining - more ambitious wellness and fitness goals!

Even though I'm a passionate mover, I can relate to the fact that life often gets in the way of our feelings of wellness and physical fitness. 

This has been my pattern many times: 

<blockquote><b>Degeneration: </b>As a student and project manager for over 10 years, I led a sedentary lifestyle. As a result, I'd develop somekind of issue (i.e. burnout, IT band syndrome, bulging disc, headaches, body aches...)</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Activation: </b>One day, I'd get fed up and move to the extreme.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Incapacitation: </b>I thought I was well-prepared but I'd usually get injured.</blockquote>  

<blockquote><b>Regeneration: </b>So I'd get help: hire a personal trainer, join group fitness class, visit a body healer etc. Everyone needs help getting out of this cycle sometimes - including well-rounded health professionals! </blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Education: </b>Sometimes, I'd pursue a certification in the therapy that helped me heal. </blockquote>

Over time, I've come to practice, integrate, and teach the many lessons I've learned.
