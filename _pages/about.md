<h2 style="color: green;">Mission</h2>

Our mission is to:
<ul>
  <li>Improve health, wellness, and happiness of all Canadians.</li>
  <li>Improve access to restorative nature, regardless of individual socioeconomic status.</li>
</ul>

We will achieve our mission by: 
<ul>
  <li>Developing targeted processes and programs to address health and wellness issues.</li>
  <li>Educating Canadian business and policy-makers to promote anti-negligence of employees and people.</li>
  <li>Liberating the natural landscape in urban centres.</li>
  <li>Advocating, with like-minded partners, for systemic change.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: green;">Vision</h2>

<p>Our vision is a physically, mentally, and emotionally resilient Canadian population. We believe that our improved processes and programs will get Canadians part-way there.</p> 

<p>The other part is advocating for design changes of our cities. Enabling access to nature within our city centres would make restorative landscapes accessible for all Canadians, regardless of socioeconomic status. This is a more equitable and less negligent system than what we currently have.</p> 

<p>We believe that conscious design of processes, programs, and urban landscapes is the necessary way of the future.</p> 

<h2 style="color: green;">Values</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Movement</li>
  <li>Nature</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Advocacy</li>
  <li>Anti-Negligence</li>
  <li>Equal Access</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: green;">Who We Are</h2>

<p>FreeTheFoot advocates for the blending of movement and nature for a happier body, community, and life.</p>

<p>We are certified personal trainers, gymnastic coaches, fascial stretch therapists, environmentalists and more. Our advanced education in anatomy, nutrition, movement, and environmental advocacy began early on in our lives and has only grown with time. Together, we have decades of experience as students - and educators.</p> 

<h4 style="color: white;">Movement</h4>
After years of observing clients and trends, we aim to address many (reversible) health and wellness issues. Their causes are often embedded in the fabric of Canadian institutions and social structures. Ergonomic assessments help to an extent, but we take it further. 

<h4 style="color: white;">Nature</h4>
In addition, we observe that to access clean air, clean fresh water, and immersion in nature - all of which are as important to our mission as movement - people must exit city centres. However, this is costly, difficult without a car, and sometimes near impossible. So an alternative is making it possible right within our urban centres - if only they were more smarterly designed.
