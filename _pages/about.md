<h2 style="color:rgb(102, 136, 114);">Mission</h2>
<p>Even if global oil and gas shortages weren't rocking our world, Hamilton's active transportation infrastructure needs to be tailored for people - not cars. FreeTheFoot's mission is to:<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that pedestrian needs are prioritized.</li> 
  <li>Expand walkability in the urban centre.</li> 
  <li>Connect amalgamated areas to urban centre with active transportation networks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: rgb(102, 136, 114);">Vision</h2>

<p>In the face of rising living costs, climate change, and demand for oil and gas, improvements in active transportation are not just desirable, but becoming more and more necessary every day to keep our city accessible and liveable. </p>

<p>FreeTheFoot envisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A robust, walkable environment, with walkable interconnections that make sense.</li> 
  <li>Greater access to nature.</li> 
  <li>More creative movement opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: rgb(102, 136, 114);">Values</h2>
