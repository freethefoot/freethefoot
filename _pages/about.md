<h2 style="color:rgb(102, 136, 114);">Mission</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To improve travel on foot within Hamilton - in its urban centres and between amalgamated areas.</li>
  <li>To establish more creative movement opportunities in Hamilton.</li>
  <li>To unite day-to-day activities with Hamilton's abdundant natural landscapes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: rgb(102, 136, 114);">Vision</h2>

<p>Our vision is greater health, wellness, and happiness of all Canadians. We believe that more movement and access to nature is key to physical, mental, and emotional resilience. Therefore, everyone should have easy access to clean and abdundant nature, as it is so closely linked to our well-being.</p>

<p>We believe in doing our part in educating Canadian businesses and policy-makers, partnering with like-minded groups, advocating for health promotion, and the liberation of nature. In doing so, we support systemic change.</p>
