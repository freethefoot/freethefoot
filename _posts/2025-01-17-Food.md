The food complex is everything needed for eating and storing snacks and full meals. 

I've written a separate blog post <a href="/_posts/2025-01-21-FoodAssembly.md">Thru-Hiking: Assembling Meals & Snacks</a> on 10 things I keep in mind when preparing my food for a hike. 

But back to the Food Complex: 

<h2 style="color: green;">List of Equipment</h2>

For a 14 day thru-hike in the summertime, here was my list of equipment: 
<ol>
    <li>12" x 12" sheet of aluminum foil</li>
    <li>Camping Stove</li>
    <li>Small cannister of fuel</li>
    <li>Water canteen & filter</li>
    <li>Camping pot complex (comes with a kettle/pot, 1 mini covered bowl, 1 insulator)</li>
    <li>Mini lighter</li>
    <li>A sturdy spork</li>
    <li>9" x 6" microfibre towel - in addition to the one I packed in my Hygiene Complex</li>
    <li>1 large zippered freezer bag - for garbage</li>
</ol>

There were many more things I could have included, but in the end (and perhaps unfortunately) the most important piece of equipment was often my garbage bag! I'm always thinking of how energy bars, pre-packaged meals, and canned food can be done in a way that is even less wasteful.

<h2 style="color: green;">Cooking on the Trail</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Find a spot secure from brush and wind (sometimes the <b>foil</b> came in handy as a wind protector).</li>
    <li>Attach my little <b>camping stove</b> to the <b>fuel cannister</b>. I found half finished cannisters for cheap at a sporting goods stores; I didn't plan to burn fuel for warmth or for hours, so I wouldn't use even a small cannister in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li>Add filtered water from the <b>canteen</b> to the <b>kettle/pot</b> and using the <b>lighter</b> to turn on the stove. Bring water to a boil.</li>
    <li>In the <b>bowl</b> use some of the boiled water to pour myself some tea or make bone broth and cover to let it steep.</li>
    <li>Directly into the <b>kettle/pot</b>, add dehydrated meal to the rest of the boiled water and allow to cook and rehydrate for several minutes.</li> 
    <li>Use the <b>spork</b> to shovel said food into my mouth!</li>
    <li>At the end of the meal, use a bit of fresh water to rinse the <b>pot</b>, <b>bowl</b>, and <b>spork</b>. Warm the water and use a bit of soap from the hygiene complex if it needs a bit of extra cleaning. Wipe up with the <b>microfibre towel</b>.</li>
    <li>Deposit any garbage into the <b>large freezer bag</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color: green;">A Minor Horror Story</h2>

One time, at the start of that thru-hike, I lost my water filter and my lighter. Not only was I disappointed by my environmental impact, but losing these two things was pretty catastrophic for my little food complex! 

I want to say that everything was okay... but it was pretty hard for 5 days until I made it back into town to repack and refuel. Because I lost my water filter (and I didn't have any water purification tablets), I had to stop and boil my water every so often. It did not cool quickly. 

And because I lost my lighter, I had to use the matches in my Other Emergencies Complex. Unfortunately, they were not top quality, so the humidity and sea breeze rendered them useless! Luckily, I had enough snacks to tide me over. But a fraction of my hardwork in dehydrating meals was spent for nothing! 

This is how I learn...
