The Hygiene Complex is for my personal cleanliness routine...

Because I use my hygiene multiple times each day, it goes at the very top of my pack. 

I selected soap and insect repellent made bylocal, conscious crafters, like <b>twigs 'n dirt</b> for their good quality and gentler impact on nature (you can find their items on my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/FreeTheFoot?ref=search_shop_redirect"> Etsy Store!</a>). And I tried to limit my waste.

    <li>Toothpaste Tablets</li> 
    <li>Silk Toothfloss - its texture cleans so well!</li>
    <li>Tissue Pack</li>
    <li>Insect Repellent - Handmade, friendlier than DDT, smells amazing.</li> 
    <li>Natural Soap - Goats 'n Oats by <b>twigs 'n dirt</b>. It worked so well and doubled as detergent.</li>
    <li>6” x 9” Microfibre Towel</li>
    <li>Daily Vitamins</li>
    <li>Alcohol Spray Bottle</li>
    <li>Lightweight Comb - I really appreciated it with the humidity.</li>
    <li>Heat Rash Cream</li>
</ol> 

I also kept space for things that are specific to my extra needs. For example, you might need orthodontic support or menstrual pads. 

Finally, I counted out smaller pieces (i.e. toothpaste tabs, soap, daily vitamins) and packed the exact amount I needed into resuable, mini zipper bags. These were packed it all together in a medium FREEZER zipper bag (freezer = durable!)
