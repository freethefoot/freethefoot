After getting very sick, I unexpectedly and suddenly became sensitive to foods I've never had trouble eating in the past. 

This sensitivity expressed itself as a headache, deep fatigue, dry & itchy eyes, dry cough, upset stomach, brain fog... But the worst were the night sweats. 

I didn't immediately know the cause, but with research and trial & error, it seemed to be a sensitivity to histamines. Some online resources (especially for histamine diets) are conflicting. So I tried a few things out on myself - none of it drastic. But I paid close attention to what made me feel better versus worse.

In addition to taking a digestive enzyme for a bit, here is what has helped me: 

<ul>
    <li>Cooking most fresh vegetables and herbs - I'm still narrowing down which fresh foods cause the worst reaction, but nothing is as bad as some fresh vegetables and herbs. So cooking them all first was a good first pass.</li>
    <li>Avoiding sugar - Processed sugar AND natural foods with high sugar content, like berries.</li>
    <li>Licorice Root Tea - Helps significantly with digestion and is sweet enough to meet sugar cravings.</li>
    <li>Adding the following foods to my daily diet: oats, flaxseed, RED CABBAGE, sweet potatoes, pears (without the skin), beets, green onions, shallots, leeks, papaya.</li>
    <li>Various techniques to calm my vaugus nerve: alternating between hot sauna & cold shower; breathing exercises, and creating feelings of safety.</li>
</ul>

When it comes to targeted recipes and vagus nerve calming, I leaned into <i><a href="https://skinfriend.com/products/the-healthy-skin-kitchen">The Healthy Skin Kitchen</a></i>, which was an amazing resource for further reading. 

I found that ADDING things has helped more than TAKING THINGS AWAY. It's still a battle - it's very hard to convince myself that I prefer the FEELING that red cabbage gives me compared to the TASTE of chocolate... but I'm pretty happy with the results (and absence of night sweats!)
