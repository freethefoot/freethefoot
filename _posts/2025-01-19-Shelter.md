On a thru-hike, I camp on the trail using the Sleep Complex. It's everything needed to create a safe space to rest and recharge.

<h2 style="color: green;">Optimizing the Sleep Complex</h2>

One of the best things I could do to make the hike more pleasant is reducing the size, weight, and complexity of the sleep complex. Here are some tips for a 12 day, summertime hike: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Easy To Assemble</b> After hiking 20km each day, the last thing I had brainpower for was assembling my tent. Luckily, it's poles snap together with little effort. And often, my fly was unnecessary because the weather was so mild.</li>
  <li><b>Compression</b> Five days in, I felt my sleeping bag was too bulky and strained the seams of my pack. When I visited the Outdoors Store to repack and refuel, I invested in a compression sack. While it didn't reduce weight, it reduced the size of my sleeping bag by half so it was much easier to transport.</li>
  <li><b>Be Cuthroat!</b> I had to coach myself that just because something comes with "extras" doesn't mean they're necessary, like tent pegs. I didn't pack them because my body weight was enough to keep my 1-person tent fixed.</li>
  <li><b>Multi-Purpose Items</b> Why pack a camping pillow when a puffy jacket will do?</li>
</ul>
