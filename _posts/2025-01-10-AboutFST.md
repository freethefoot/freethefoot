On a basic level, fascia stretch therapy is an assisted stretching technique performed by an FST practioner on a client. 

The client is mostly passive, but sometimes they move and contract their muscles a minor amount. 

In 2017, I received FST for the first time. My calves were too tight, so my personal trainer sat on the ground while I leaned forward. They held my leg right above my ankle, straightened their arms, leaned back, and swayed right and left. This moved my leg skin and muscle back and forth. The relief was so profound from such a simple move that that I was hooked!

I completed a Fascial Stretch Therapy Level 1 course with <a href="https://www.stretchtowin.com/page/what-is-fst">Stretch To Win</a> and re-certified in 2020. When I got back from the week-long course, I practiced FST on everyone. Some people were as crazy about it as I was. But even the skeptics said they felt more relaxed and had a good sleep afterward. 

I love FST because it provides such relief and can unlock greater movement potential. It also shares very basic principles with other therapies, such as osteopathy and massage therapy, that release the body even further. As a personal trainer, I'm be qualified to perform FST on my clients. But we can work together to make sure you are finding the right team to support your body's needs!
