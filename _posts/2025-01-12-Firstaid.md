By going on a long thru-hike I naturally open myself up to risks I don't face daily.

The First Aid Complex helps with things that are self-treatable (i.e. headaches, blisters). And even though I'm often tempted to over pack, I try to stick to items I'd realistically use. 

For greater emergencies, I make sure to pack clothes that can double as gauze or a sling. And I bring my phone (to check my location) with an emergency battery pack just in case.

Because First Aid items are IMPORTANT, I keep them as dry/in tact as possible - otherwise they might spoil. So I sometimes store them with rice to keep moisture away or keep them in their original blister packs (but cut down the pack into smaller pieces).

For my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XCFHHW_uv4">Newfoundland Thru-Hike</a>, I went out and got a mini first aid kid to start. Then I took out a few things and added a few things. 

<h2 style="color: green;">Equipment</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Acetaminophen</li> 
    <li>Ibuprofen - packed in with rice to ward off moisture.</li>
    <li>Allergy Medication - I cut down the blister pack it came in.</li>
    <li>Polysporin</li> 
    <li>Sunscreen Stick</li>
    <li>Fabric Bandaids</li>
    <li>Alcohol wipes</li>
    <li>Heat Rash Cream - I moved this to my daily-use hygiene kit.</li>
</ol> 

<h2 style="color: green;">Deciding What to Pack</h2>

With the first aid complex, I DO NOT use weight reduce an item. Instead, I ask myself: 

<ul>
    <li>"If I needed this (i.e. for a headache or soreness) how many would I need?"</li>
    <li>"Will this really be able to help me (i.e. is the bandaid adhesive fresh or old?)"</li>
    <li>"How many things can I use this for (i.e. gauze takes up space but it's versatile)?"</li>
</ul>

For this hike, the most common first-aid issue I got was blisters. So I'm so glad I ADDED more good-quality bandaids and more alcohol wipes! It sounds like nothing, but a gnarly blister festering in my moist boot nearly ruined my hike. 

And I packed all of this into a medium-sized FREEZER zipper back (freezer = durable).
