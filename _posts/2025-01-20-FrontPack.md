The Hiking Complex includes everything to get up and go - including my backpack and a smaller front pack with everything in it.  

Whereas my backpack contains everything listed in previous articles (food, shelter, clothes), my frontpack contains everything I need easily on hand.

<h2 style="color: green;">Troubleshooting</h2>

One thing I learned was how important it is to have a sturdy, smartly designed front back. Initially, I was using a small lightweight backpack. But it fell apart very quickly with the constant swinging - even duct tape couldn't hold it together by the end. Not only that, the zipper was inaccessible, and there was no water bottle holder. 

So I went out and selected my frontpack with greater care. I invested in a sturdy fanny pack and it was a game changer! It had several easily accessible pockets, elastic cords, and not one but two water bottle holders. This made accessing my water, maps, phone, chapstick, and more much easier. And because it was a fanny pack, it's secured around my hips instead of my chest, so I feel more ergonomic.
