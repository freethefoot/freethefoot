This complex helps with immediate issues that are NOT health related - so I can keep hiking safely OR to tide me over until I can exit the trail.

<h2 style="color: green;">Equipment</h2>

For a hike of the East Coast Trail in August, here's what I packed:

<ol>
    <li>Mini roll of duct tape</li>
    <li>Plastic bags (two)</li>
    <li>Waterproof matches (in addition to the lighter in my food complex)</li>
    <li>Small tissue pack</li>
    <li>Re-chargable battery pack</li>
    <li>Headlamp</li>
    <li>Combination pocket knife</li>
    <li>Multi-purpose Foil Rescue Blanket</li> 
    <li>Rope (2m)</li> 
    <li>Whistle</li>
    <li>Compass - thankfully I practiced how to use this + a hardcopy map because it works so differently than location services!</li>
    <li>Carabiner (just one)</li>
</ol> 

<h2 style="color: green;">Deciding What to Pack</h2>

For this complex, I weigh each item and asked myself these questions: 

<ul>
    <li>"What would I need if my [tent, map, stove, shoes] fail(s)?"</li>
    <li>"Can I get this in a smaller/lighter size? (i.e. big vs tiny duct tape rolls)"</li>
    <li>"How many things can I use this for? (i.e. duct tape for mending clothes AND tent)"</li>
</ul>

And as always, for more complex emergencies I check my location often and bring an emergency battery pack in case I needed to call for help. 

<h2 style="color: green;">Tips</h2>

Of all these items, the duct tape was the most handy. It reinforced my pack and my Vibrams when I wore them out!

The next most useful items were the plastic bags; I wore them like socks to keep my feet dry in the wettest parts of the trail. I'd recommend also investing in excellent quality matches and adding to this water purification tablets.
