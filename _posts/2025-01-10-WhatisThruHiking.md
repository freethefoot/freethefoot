One of the ways I like to test my own advice is by thru-hiking! 

Thru-hiking is basically a multi-day, end-to-end hike. Thru-hikers tend to have all of their gear with them so that they may eat and sleep on the trail. Occasionally they hop off the trail to explore nearby towns or to re-stock supplies.

When planning for a thru-hike, my main goal is for everything to make sense, to be easily accessible, and easily packable. To achieve this, I have two main strategies: 

<b>1. Complexes:</b> When preparing for a thru-hike, like many other hikers, I divide my needs based on these things. And I pack these things separately, like different rooms in a house:

<ol>
    <li>Hygiene</li>
    <li>First Aid</li>
    <li>Other Emergencies</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Clothing</li>
    <li>Shelter</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
</ol>

<b>2. Ultralight:</b> "Ultralight" backpacking tends to mean that your pack (all of your stuff except the clothes on your back) weighs anywhere between 5-20lbs. Some people get really into it and shave off unused bits of canvas, snap their toothbrushes in half to discard everything but the bristles, and no tent - just a tarp. This is not exactly for me. 

With average equipment (not expensive ultralight stuff) and all of my food, my pack weighs ~35lbs. However I do take these steps to lighten my load:
<ul>
  <li>Weigh ALL my items (in grams)</li>
  <li>Record weight on a spreadsheet & calculate totals</li>
  <li>Brainstorm lighter options</li>
  <li>Testing gear & meals beforehand</li>
</ul>

It's incredible how much room for improvement you make for yourself just by testing gear out on a long walk and seeing those numbers add up on a spreadsheet. Like, do I really need THREE pairs of shoes? Or can I get away with 1...

Also, what you need for your hike will change over time, depending on various factors including: 

<ul>
    <li>Location (is water nearby? is there no water nearby? high or low altitude?)</li>
    <li>Duration (pack more food or less food?)</li> 
    <li>Season (clothing for fall vs summer?)</li> 
    <li>Terrain (running shoes or hiking boots?) and more</li>
</ul>

In the next series of posts, you'll find more details on how I arrange my items into <b>complexes</b> and aim to be <b>ultralight</b>. I'm still learning every day. so if you decide to thru-hike, make sure to adapt these strategies to your own needs!
