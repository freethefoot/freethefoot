FreeTheFoot was born from building connections with people who are passionate about questions of movement and nature...

<blockquote>Is it our fault that we don't move when our jobs demand we sit? What if moving is affected by a lack of fresh air and shelter against traffic? Should I move if my body hurts?</blockquote> 

These were just some of the questions that sparked FreeTheFoot back in 2018. 

On a basic level, FreeTheFoot started when its founder was introduced to minimalist (or "zero drop") footwear. Suddenly, regular running shoes seemed to make concentration, balance, and movement harder... and many other people on social media and in her new movement circle felt the same way. 

This journey unfolded further in the StretchToWin classroom for Fascial Stretch Therapy Level 1, where many like-minded professionals gathered to learn new skills. Here was evidence that some passionate personal trainers, physiotherapists, osteopaths, massage therapists, rehabilitation specialists, doctors - and the list goes on - were all having conversations similar to the questions above. Here was a group of people upskilling their professional practice to try to do something about it. 

The journey of discovery continued into the halls of nature - learning about natural building concepts (such as building with clay) that are symbiotic with human health needs; urban design that focuses on the free flow of people; improving access to gardening and nature in urban settings, and the list goes on.  

Today, "FreeTheFoot" means more than just wearing minimalist shoes. It means trading in sedentary lifestyles for ones filled with movement - and even better, moving within nature. Sometimes this means changing our footwear, other times it means investigating the root cause of our issues, and many times it means advocating for healthier communities.  

Some of FreeTheFoot's activities include participating in <a href="https://www.hamilton.ca/sites/default/files/2022-11/biking-cyclists-mobility-lab-cycling-network-terms-of-refrence.pdf">City of Hamilton's Cycling Network</a> to improve our network of bike paths and working with Cable14 to produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ux2XqidBVs">a short documentary on walking across Hamilton</a> using its extensive trail network. 

There is no way into the future but one that is more conscious of the things we have learned today.
