FreeTheFoot was born from building connections with people who are as puzzled by movement questions as I am...

Is it our fault that we don't move when our jobs demand we sit? What if moving is affected by a lack of fresh air and shelter against traffic? Should I move if my body hurts? 

On a basic level, FreeTheFoot started in 2018 when my personal trainer introduced me to minimal (or "zero drop") footwear and fascia health. I trained in Vibrams (or 5 finger shoes) for the first time and the experience made my brain feel tingly! Suddenly, my toes were working! Suddenly, regular running shoes seemed to make concentration, balance, and movement harder...

So I bought hot pink toe shoes and wore them everywhere, even the office. And I even experimented walking completely barefoot around the city ("grounding"). 

Today, "FreeTheFoot" means more than just walking around in minimalist shoes. It means trading in sedentary lifestyles for ones filled with movement. Sometimes this means healing our bodies, other times it means improving our footwear.

And other times it means working in our communities to create better OPPORTUNITIES to move. So I participate in <a href="https://www.hamilton.ca/sites/default/files/2022-11/biking-cyclists-mobility-lab-cycling-network-terms-of-refrence.pdf">City of Hamilton's Cycling Network</a> to improve our network of bike paths and have produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ux2XqidBVs">a short documentary on walking across Hamilton</a> using its extensive trail network. Enjoy!
