The Clothing Complex anything I wear while hiking, as well as my thru-hike "closet". 

These items take up the most space and are the heaviest. And they're such a gamble for how much they weigh! Sometimes you don't use them; other times you wish you had more.  

<h2 style="color: green;">Equipment</h2>

This is what I <b>INITIALLY</b> packed for a two-week, summertime trip where I knew it could get very cold, windy, and rainy:

<ol>
    <li>Down jacket: short (doubled as a pillow)</li>
    <li>Waterproof jacket: short, waterproof, with a hood</li>
    <li>Fleece sweater: short, with a hood</li>
    <li>Cotton shirt: zip up, with a hood</li>
    <li>2 t-shirts: white, cotton</li>
    <li>1 pair of hiking pants: waterproof, zippered to double as shorts, LOVED these</li> 
    <li>1 pair of biking shorts: black, spandex/cotton blend</li>
    <li>1 bra: cotton</li>
    <li>2 pairs underwear: cotton</li>
    <li>2 pairs of socks: cotton</li>
    <li>1 pair of hiking boots: semi-waterproof</li>
    <li>1 pair of vibrams: lightweight</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color: green;">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Material Selection</h3> 

<p><b>Error: Cotton.</b>I was going for inexpensive, lightweight, and reflective material. But packing so much cotton was a mistake for several reasons: 
<ol>
  <li>Just a few days in it started to smell horribly;</li>
  <li>It picked up dirt so easily;</li>
  <li>It was not easy to wash and did not dry quickly;</li> 
  <li>I was damp and uncomfortable.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Fix: Wool.</b> I didn't have a lot of faith in wool at the start. It can be itchy and hot right? Plus, it's very expensive. But halfway through my hike, buying ACTIVEWEAR wool-blend t-shirts, socks, and underwear was a GAME CHANGER. They never smelled, they were easy to wash and quick-drying, and I wasn't itchy or hot. What an amazing technological advance!</p>

<h3>Footwear</h3>

<p><b>Error: Lightweight Vibrams & "Semi" Waterproof Boots.</b> I love minimalist footwear so it was hard for me to accept that bringing along lightweight Vibrams maybe wasn't the best idea. The terrain was rocky, wet, and challenging, so the fact that they had no cushion became almost painful, they were soaked most of the time,  and with their fabric blend, they wore through very quickly. Walking on rocks is great natural reflexology, but even I have my limits.</p> 

<p>So then I turned to my semi-waterproof boots. When it comes to hikes with ankle deep mud, these hiking boots were key. However, they were only "semi" waterproof, which meant that mud and water seeped in. Then they got stinky, very stinky.</p> 

<p><b>Fix: Hiking Sandals.</b> Personally, I'm not a fan of their aesthetic but I fell in love with my hiking sandals. They had a sturdy covered toe, holes for air circulation, they dried quickly, I could wear them with socks to stop blisters, and they had a bit of a bounce to them which gave my foot extra help across long distances. They were a great alternative to my Vibrams and boots.</p>

<p>There is so much room for improvement even after I fixed my miscalculations. But after troubleshooting at the local outdoors store, I gained a solid foundation of things I'll use for years to come.</p>
